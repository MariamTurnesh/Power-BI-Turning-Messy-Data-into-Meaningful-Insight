## Project Focus

Real-world data is rarely analysis-ready. This project demonstrates how Power BI is used to:

- Clean and transform messy data using **Power Query**
- Model data using **fact and dimension tables**
- Build correct **one-to-many relationships**
- Create meaningful **DAX measures**
- Design dashboards that respond correctly to slicers and filters

The emphasis is on **data preparation, modeling, and analytical thinking**, not just visuals.

## Key Learnings

- Most analytics work happens *before* dashboards are built  
- Clean data alone isn’t enough — **proper modeling matters**
- Fact and dimension tables are critical for reliable filtering
- DAX defines business meaning, not just calculations
- A good data model is invisible, but its absence is obvious

---

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI  
- Power Query  
- DAX

## About This Project

This repository reflects hands-on learning with realistic data challenges and is intended as a **portfolio project** demonstrating end-to-end Power BI analysis.
